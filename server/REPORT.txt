UDP SMTP client:

Implements reliable connection oriented UDP using UDT application layer protocol.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP-based_Data_Transfer_Protocol
It is kind of like TCP over UDP but faster for transfering large amounts of data.

Random numbers are generated using Random.org. 
Base64 encoding and decoding is performed with the PHP script provided. My machine should be online when you are testing it, if it is not, the script 
can be hosted on any web server supporting https. Just replace all instances with services.117.bz with your web server.
